# Room Description

**Title**: Hamlet

**Description**: A Shakespeare/Hamlet-inspired room in which you will explore an uncommon web application.

**Tags**: security, web, docker, linux, ctf

## Tasks

### Task 1: To hack, or not to hack, that is the question

Objective: Get root on the researcher's server and access the flag(s).

Welcome to Hamlet!

This is a fairly straightforward CTF-like room in which you will play with an uncommon web application used in linguistic research. You will also learn a little bit about Docker. While there are CTF elements, there are quite a few "real" problems in here. Feel free to explore!

In the associated GitHub repository, you will find detailed information about this room as well as the learning objectives. That said, I would recommend trying this room as a challenge first.

There's a total of six flags. You don't necessarily have to find them in order. (**Flags:** THM{#_flag})

Please note that the machine takes a while to fully boot and some services will only become available after a minute or so.

#### Questions

Question 1: What is Michael's password? (Hint: You will, most likely, create a wordlist and test against WebAnno.)

`REDACTED`

Questions 2 to 8: Flags [REDACTED]
